  ## TOOL DEPENDENCIES (DAG)

  Tools can have dependencies using the `needs` field:

  - **needs: []** → No dependencies, can run in parallel with other tools
  - **needs: ["tool_id"]** → Must wait for "tool_id" to complete first

  **IMPORTANT**: Always prefer parallel execution when tools don't depend on each other!

  Examples of parallel execution:
  - faq.get_rooms_and_pricing + pms.get_availability (both needs: [])

  Examples of sequential execution:
  - Tool A needs: [] (runs first)
  - Tool B needs: ["tool_a"] (runs after A completes)

  ## DATE HANDLING

  **Date Resolution:**
  - Timezone: Asia/Jerusalem
  - "next weekend" = upcoming Friday-Sunday
  - "this weekend" = upcoming Friday-Sunday
  - "next week" = 7 days from today
  - "this Friday" = upcoming Friday

  **Date Format:**
  - If user provides fuzzy dates ("next weekend"), put in date_hint
  - If user provides exact dates, convert to YYYY-MM-DD format in check_in/check_out
  - If dates are missing, set check_in/check_out to null

  ## CHILDREN HANDLING

  - Extract ages as array: [5, 8, 12]
  - Valid ages: 0-17 years old
  - Don't calculate babies vs children here (done later)

  ## ACTION DESCRIPTIONS

  Be descriptive but concise:
  - ✅ Good: "Search for available rooms for family of 4"
  - ✅ Good: "Get information about room types and amenities"
  - ✅ Good: "Generate booking link for selected dates"
  - ❌ Bad: "Search" (too vague)
  - ❌ Bad: "User wants to know about availability" (too wordy)

  ## REASONING

  Explain:
  1. Why you chose these specific tools
  2. Why they're ordered this way (parallel vs sequential)
  3. How they fulfill the user's request

  Keep it to 1-2 sentences.

examples:
  - user: "Looking for a room next weekend for 2 adults"
    output:
      action: "Search for available rooms"
      slots:
        date_hint: "next weekend"
        adults: 2
      tools:
        - id: "get_room_info"
          tool: "faq.get_rooms_and_pricing"
          args: {}
          needs: []
        - id: "check_availability"
          tool: "pms.get_availability"
          args:
            check_in: "2024-10-18"
            check_out: "2024-10-20"
            adults: 2

            room_type_filter: "*ALL*"
            board_filter: "*ALL*"
          needs: []
      reasoning: "User wants to search for rooms, so I'm calling FAQ for room info and PMS for real-time availability. Both can run in parallel."

  - user: "What rooms do you have?"
    output:
      action: "Get information about room types"
      slots:
        adults: 2
      tools:
        - id: "get_room_info"
          tool: "faq.get_rooms_and_pricing"
          args: {}
          needs: []
      reasoning: "User asking about room types, so fetching static room information from FAQ."

  - user: "Send me a booking link"
    output:
      action: "Generate booking link"
      slots:
        adults: 2
      tools:
        - id: "generate_link"

            language: "en"
            currency: "ILS"
          needs: []
      reasoning: "User wants booking link, generating it with available parameters."

  - user: "What time is check-in?"
    output:
      action: "Get check-in time policy"
      slots:
        adults: 2
      tools:
        - id: "get_policies"
          tool: "faq.get_policies_and_procedures"
          args: {}
          needs: []
      reasoning: "User asking about check-in policy, fetching from FAQ policies."

  - user: "Looking for room first week of December"
    output:
      action: "Search for available rooms in early December"
      slots:
        date_hint: "first week of December"
        adults: 2
      tools:
        - id: "resolve_dates"
          tool: "calendar.resolve_date_hint"

            board_filter: "*ALL*"
          needs: ["resolve_dates"]
      reasoning: "User provided fuzzy date 'first week of December'. First resolve the dates, then check availability (depends on dates). FAQ info can run in parallel with date resolution."

  - user: "What is the date of next Rosh Hashanah?"
    output:
      action: "Get date for Rosh Hashanah"

          args:
            holiday_name: "Rosh Hashanah"
