| **3** | 2 rooms in July for a week | ‚ö†Ô∏è Resolved July 1-7, 2026 but made **5 duplicate API calls** | **Inefficiency:** Called API 5x for same data | Make 1 API call, check `available` count |

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)

### 1. **Duplicate API Calls** (Scenarios 3, 7)
- **Problem:** Multi-room requests = multiple identical API calls
- **Fix:** Check availability ONCE, verify inventory count from response

### 2. **PMS-to-FAQ Mapping Missing** (Scenario 6)
- **Problem:** Can't match PMS "Room 15084" to FAQ "CHOCHMA suite with mountain view"
- **Fix:** Create mapping file `pms_code ‚Üí suite_name`

### 3. **Data Hallucination** (Scenario 7)
- **Problem:** LLM invents guest ages when user is vague
- **Fix:** Never assume demographics, ask for clarification instead

### 4. **Missing Requirement Extraction** (Scenarios 5, 10)
- **Problem:** Budget, accessibility, pets not captured in `compare_criteria`
- **Fix:** Improve slot extraction prompt to capture ALL requirements

### 5. **No Negative Response** (Scenarios 9, 10)
- **Problem:** Doesn't tell user when property can't meet needs
- **Fix:** Add logic: if FAQ missing required amenity ‚Üí inform user
