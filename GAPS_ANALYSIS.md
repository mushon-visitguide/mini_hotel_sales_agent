# Implementation Gaps: Your System vs Gemini CLI (Post-Hooks)

## ✅ What We Fixed with Hooks

| Feature | Before | After (Now) |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Observability** | ❌ No visibility into execution | ✅ Full event tracking |
| **Metrics** | ❌ No performance data | ✅ Timing, success rate, per-tool stats |
| **Monitoring** | ❌ No slow tool detection | ✅ Automatic warnings |
| **Extensibility** | ❌ Hard to add features | ✅ Plugin architecture via hooks |
| **Production Ready** | 🟡 Limited | ✅ Logging, metrics, alerts |

**Status: You now match Gemini CLI's observability!**

---

## ❌ Critical Gaps Remaining

### 1. **No Feedback Loop / Adaptive Execution** 🔴 CRITICAL

**Your System:**
```python
# Single pass - no adaptation
plan = await planner.plan(message)  # LLM call #1
results = await runtime.execute(plan.tools)
response = await responder.generate(results)  # LLM call #2

# If a tool fails or returns unexpected data → GAME OVER
```

**Gemini CLI:**
```typescript
// Iterative loop - adapts based on results
while (agentTurnActive) {
  llmResponse = await gemini.sendMessage(history)  // Sees all previous results

  if (llmResponse.has_tool_calls) {
    results = await executeTools(llmResponse.tool_calls)
    history.push(results)  // Add to history
    // Loop continues - LLM sees results and can adjust
  } else {
    break  // No more tool calls, done
  }
}
```

**Real Example:**
```
User: "Book room for Hanukkah"

Gemini CLI:
  LLM → [calendar.resolve_date("Hanukkah")]
  Result: "8 nights (Dec 14-22)"
  LLM sees result → "That's unusual, let me check 2 nights instead"
  LLM → [availability(Dec 14-16)]
  ✅ Adapts based on intermediate results

Your System:
  LLM → Plans: [calendar, availability(8 nights)]
  Execute: calendar ✓, availability(8 nights) ❌ fails
  ❌ Can't adapt, stuck with original plan
```

**Impact:** 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Can't recover from failures or adjust strategy

---

### 2. **No Streaming Responses** 🟡 HIGH

**Your System:**
```python
# User waits for entire response
response = self.llm.chat_completion(messages)  # Blocking
# ... 3 seconds ...
print(response)  # All at once
```

**Gemini CLI:**
```typescript
// Response appears word-by-word
for await (const chunk of gemini.generateContentStream(...)) {
  process.stdout.write(chunk.text)  // Immediate feedback
}
```

**User Experience:**
```
Without Streaming (yours):
  User: "Check availability"
  [... 3 second wait ...]
  Bot: [Full response appears]

With Streaming (Gemini):
  User: "Check availability"
  Bot: "Let" → "me" → "check" → "availability" → "for" → "you..."
  [Feels alive and responsive]
```

**Impact:** 🟡 **HIGH** - Poor UX, feels slow even when it's not

---

### 3. **Separate Planning & Response = Extra LLM Call** 🟡 MEDIUM

**Your System:**
```python
# 2 separate LLM calls
plan = await planner.plan(message)        # LLM Call #1 - Plan tools
results = await runtime.execute(tools)    # Execute
response = await responder.generate(...)  # LLM Call #2 - Generate response

# Cost: 2x API calls
# Latency: LLM latency + execution time + LLM latency again
```

**Gemini CLI:**
```typescript
// 1 integrated call (per turn)
response = await gemini.sendMessage(...)
// Returns: { text: "...", tool_calls: [...] }

// Text and tools in SAME response
// Cost: 1x API call per turn
```

**Impact:** 🟡 **MEDIUM** - Higher cost, higher latency

---

### 4. **No Result Validation with Auto-Replanning** 🟡 MEDIUM

**Your System:**
```python
# Planner doesn't see results, can't validate
plan = await planner.plan(message)  # Blind planning
results = await runtime.execute(plan.tools)
# Results might be invalid, but no way to replan
response = await responder.generate(results)  # Just formats what we got
```

**Gemini CLI:**
```typescript
// LLM sees results and validates
results = await executeTools(toolCalls)
history.push(results)  // Add to conversation

response = await gemini.sendMessage(history)  // LLM sees results
// LLM can:
// - Validate results make sense
// - Call different tools if needed
// - Try alternative approach
```

**Real Example:**
```
User: "Check availability for December 25"

Your System:
  Plan: [check availability Dec 25]
  Execute: Returns [] (no availability)
  Response: "No rooms available"
  ❌ Stops here

Gemini CLI:
  LLM → [check availability Dec 25]
  Result: [] (no availability)
  LLM sees empty result → "Let me check nearby dates"
  LLM → [check availability Dec 26]
  Result: [rooms available]
  Response: "Dec 25 is full, but Dec 26 has rooms!"
  ✅ Automatically tries alternatives
```

**Impact:** 🟡 **MEDIUM** - Less helpful to users, can't recover from edge cases

---

### 5. **Limited Error Recovery** 🟡 MEDIUM

**Your System:**
```python
try:
    result = await registry.call(tool.tool, **args)
    # Emits tool_complete event
except Exception as e:
    # Emits tool_error event
    raise  # Propagates up, execution stops
```

**What happens:** Tool fails → entire request fails

**Gemini CLI:**
```typescript
try {
  result = await executeTool(toolCall)
} catch (error) {
  // Return error as tool result
  result = { error: error.message }
}

// Continue execution - LLM sees error in next turn
history.push({ role: "function", name: toolName, content: JSON.stringify(result) })

// LLM can decide what to do:
// - Try different tool
// - Retry with different params
// - Give up gracefully
```

**Impact:** 🟡 **MEDIUM** - Can't gracefully handle tool failures

---

### 6. **No Multi-Turn Tool Calling** 🟡 MEDIUM

**Your System:**
```python
# Single turn - all tools planned upfront
plan = await planner.plan(message)  # Plans ALL tools at once
results = await runtime.execute(plan.tools)  # Execute all
# Done
```

**Gemini CLI:**
```typescript
// Multi-turn - can call tools multiple times
turn = 1
while (hasMoreWork) {
  response = await gemini.sendMessage(history)  // Turn 1: LLM calls tools A, B

  if (response.tool_calls) {
    results = await executeTools(response.tool_calls)  // Execute A, B
    history.push(results)
    turn++  // Turn 2: LLM sees A, B results, calls tool C
  } else {
    break
  }
}
```

**When This Matters:**
```
User: "Find me a room near the beach"

Your System (single turn):
  Plan: [get_all_rooms, filter_by_location]
  ❌ Can't plan "filter_by_location" because don't know what rooms exist yet

Gemini CLI (multi-turn):
  Turn 1: LLM → [get_all_rooms]
  Result: [Room A, Room B, Room C]
  Turn 2: LLM sees results → [get_location_for_room("Room A"), get_location_for_room("Room B")]
  Result: Room A is beachfront, Room B is inland
  Turn 3: LLM → response with Room A
  ✅ Can discover information progressively
```

**Impact:** 🟡 **MEDIUM** - Limited to tasks that can be planned upfront

## 🔄 Feedback Loop Implementation Options

### Option A: Simple Retry on Failure
```python
class Orchestrator:
    async def process_message(self, message, max_retries=1):
        for attempt in range(max_retries + 1):
            # Plan
            plan = await self.planner.plan(message)

            # Execute
            results = await self.runtime.execute(plan.tools)

            # Check for failures
            failures = [r for r in results.values() if isinstance(r, dict) and "error" in r]

            if not failures or attempt == max_retries:
                break

            # Re-plan with error context
            error_context = f"Previous attempt failed: {failures}"
            plan = await self.planner.replan(message, errors=error_context)

        # Generate response
        response = await self.responder.generate(results)
        return response
```

**Pros:** Simple, addresses basic failures
**Cons:** Only retries, doesn't adapt strategy

### Option B: Iterative Execution (Like Gemini CLI)
```python
class Orchestrator:
    async def process_message(self, message, max_turns=5):
        conversation_history = []

        for turn in range(max_turns):
            # Plan next step based on history
            plan = await self.planner.plan(message, history=conversation_history)

            if not plan.tools:
                # No more tools needed
                break

            # Execute tools
            results = await self.runtime.execute(plan.tools)

            # Add to history
            conversation_history.append({
                'plan': plan,
                'results': results
            })

            # Check if planner wants to continue
            should_continue = await self.planner.should_continue(conversation_history)
            if not should_continue:
                break

        # Generate final response
        response = await self.responder.generate(conversation_history)
        return response
```

**Pros:** Full adaptation, like Gemini CLI
**Cons:** More complex, more LLM calls

### Option C: Hybrid (Best of Both)
```python
class Orchestrator:
    async def process_message(self, message):
        # Phase 1: Upfront planning (your strength)
        plan = await self.planner.plan(message)

        # Phase 2: Execute with validation
        results = await self.runtime.execute(plan.tools)

        # Phase 3: Validate results
        validation = await self.validator.check_results(plan, results)

        if validation.needs_replanning:
            # Phase 4: Adaptive replanning (Gemini CLI strength)
            new_plan = await self.planner.replan(
                message,
                previous_plan=plan,
                previous_results=results,
                validation_issues=validation.issues
            )

            additional_results = await self.runtime.execute(new_plan.tools)
            results.update(additional_results)

        # Phase 5: Generate response
        response = await self.responder.generate(results)
        return response
```

**Pros:** Combines your efficiency with Gemini's adaptability
**Cons:** Moderate complexity
