Happy anniversary! Could you please share your check-in and check-out dates so I can find the perfect room for your special stay?

For next weekend (Fri, Oct 31–Sun, Nov 2), The Way Inn has 8 beautiful rooms available for 2 adults. Prices range from 1,560–1,960 ILS for 2 nights, each including a king bed, luxury linens, and a romantic welcome (wine & treats). Would you like breakfast included, or room only?

[ASSISTANT]
Great, we have 8 lovely rooms available from Friday to Sunday, with prices from 1,560–1,960 ILS for 2 nights—each includes a king bed, luxury linens, and a romantic welcome with wine & treats. Which room would you like to reserve? And could you please share your full name and a phone number or email for confirmation?

[USER]
king bed

[ASSISTANT]
All 8 available rooms feature a king bed, so you can choose any! To reserve, could you please share your full name and either a phone number or email for confirmation?

[USER]
whats the difference?

[ASSISTANT]
Here’s a quick comparison of the 8 available suites with a **king bed**:

- All rooms have a king bed (many can be separated), ensuite bathroom, AC, espresso machine, wine & treats, and unique local art.
- Some suites offer extras: private terrace (Chochma, Bina), mountain views (Chochma, Bina, Tiferet), or a bathtub (Chesed); others have a courtyard or larger space.
- A few suites fit extra guests (Da’at, Chesed, Tiferet), while others are designed just for couples.
