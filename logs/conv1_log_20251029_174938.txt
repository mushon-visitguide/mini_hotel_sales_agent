Here’s a quick comparison of the 8 available suites with a **king bed**:

- All rooms have a king bed (many can be separated), ensuite bathroom, AC, espresso machine, wine & treats, and unique local art.
- Some suites offer extras: private terrace (Chochma, Bina), mountain views (Chochma, Bina, Tiferet), or a bathtub (Chesed); others have a courtyard or larger space.
- A few suites fit extra guests (Da’at, Chesed, Tiferet), while others are designed just for couples.
