[USER]
Hey need 2 rooms for my family

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for your request! Could you please share your check-in and check-out dates so I can check availability for 2 rooms for your family?

[USER]
spring break probably, not totally sure yet

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for letting me know! Could you please confirm your exact check-in and check-out dates for spring break? That way, I can check availability for 2 rooms for your family.

[USER]
maybe like march 20-something? we have 2 families

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for sharing! For a 7-night stay starting Sunday and checking out on Palm Sunday, March 29, 2026, could you confirm if this matches your plans? Once you confirm the check-in date, I can check availability for 2 rooms for both families.

[USER]
me + wife + our 3 kids, and my sister + her husband + their 2 kids

[ASSISTANT]
For your group (2 rooms, 2 families, March 22–29, 2026), The Way Inn has 3 available suites—each different in size and price:

- **מלכות**: Open-plan grand suite, fits up to 7 in one space (from 11,000–12,750 ILS per week)
- יסוד: 2-room suite, fits 2 adults + up to 4 kids in separate rooms (from 10,240–11,990 ILS per week)
- תפארת: Smaller suite for 2 adults + 1 child (from 10,240–11,990 ILS per week)

Each is only available once—please confirm which family would like which suite, or let me know your preferences so I can assist with booking!

[USER]
mine are 10, 7, and 5. hers are 9 and 6

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for sharing everyone’s ages! To match the best suites to each family, could you let me know which family would prefer the מלכות (open-plan for up to 7), the יסוד (2 rooms, up to 4 kids in a separate room), or the תפארת (smaller, for 2 adults + 1 child)? Just let me know your preferences and I’ll reserve them for you right away!

[USER]
maybe 3 or 4 nights?

[ASSISTANT]
Great news—both 3 and 4 nights are available for your group, with all suites open for either option:

- **3 nights** (March 25–28): מלכות (₪5,000), יסוד/הוד (₪5,410), תפארת (₪4,660) per suite
- **4 nights** (March 25–29): מלכות (₪7,800), יסוד/הוד (₪7,340), תפארת (₪6,340) per suite

Each suite is unique (מלכות is grand open-plan for 7; יסוד/הוד are 2-room up to 4 kids; תפארת for 2+1). Which duration and suite(s) work best for each family? Let me know and I’ll hold them for you!

[USER]

[USER]

[ASSISTANT]
The Way Inn does not serve breakfast to individual guests—there is no breakfast included or available for adults or children. Great nearby cafes offer breakfast within a 4-minute walk. Would you like recommendations?

[USER]
